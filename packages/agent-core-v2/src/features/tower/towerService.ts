/**
 * `tower` domain — `IAgentTowerService` implementation.
 *
 * Tracks tower-mode enter/exit in the `wire` `TowerModel` (mutated only
 * through the `tower_mode.enter` / `tower_mode.exit` Ops, read through
 * `wire.getModel`), and derives the `towerMode` slice of
 * `agent.status.updated` from the Ops' `toEvent`. Also carries the
 * tower-mode harness constraints as `onBeforeExecuteTool` veto listeners.
 * The first denies `TodoList` while tower mode is active: mission state
 * lives in the tower protocol, and todo semantics ("keep exactly one task
 * in_progress") would serialize a fleet that exists to run in parallel —
 * tower mode is per-agent, so this only ever fires for the tower itself and
 * workers keep their TodoList. The second is the tower-worker write guard
 * (port of v1's `tower-worker-write-guard-deny`
 * policy): a `tower-worker`-profile agent's Write/Edit is confined to the
 * worktree its roster entry records (`.tower/worktrees/<slot>` under the
 * repo root, resolved through the `tower` protocol store from
 * `sessionContext.cwd`); any declared write access outside it is vetoed with
 * the v1 message verbatim. v1 keyed the confinement on the worker's cwd
 * override, which was always set; v2 has no per-agent cwd, so a worker
 * without a roster entry (or with no readable `.tower` state) is simply
 * outside the protocol and the guard abstains. `AskUserQuestion` is
 * deliberately not vetoed here: the tower (the main agent) may ask the human
 * to clarify requirements, while workers and reviewers cannot ask at all —
 * their `tower-worker` profile does not list the tool. Bound at Agent scope.
